# Dr. Ali Yousef Abbas — Portfolio

## About Me
I am **Dr. Ali Yousef Abbas**, a PhD holder in Informatics Engineering (Computer Vision). I design and build high‑performance imaging and geospatial systems, from classical image processing pipelines to modern 3D GIS viewers. I enjoy turning complex research into production‑ready software.

- PhD in Computer Vision
- 20+ years in Image Processing, GIS, CNC, and Software Development
- Specialized in **NASA WorldWind** and 3D mapping systems

Open to *remote roles* and *relocation*. I can contribute across the stack: algorithms, data, and user‑facing tools.
