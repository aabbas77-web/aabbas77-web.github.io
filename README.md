## üíº Experience

Over the past two decades, I have worked as a **Full Stack Developer, Software Engineer, and Project Manager**, delivering advanced solutions across multiple industries. From **2001 to 2024**, I served as a **Project Manager at the Higher Institute for Applied Sciences and Technology (HIAST)**, leading projects in computer vision, GIS, and digital image processing, while also mentoring developers and engineers. During this time, I also contributed to the **General Organization for Technical Industries (OTI)** on a GPS-based vehicle tracking system.

In parallel, I have built a strong freelance and entrepreneurial career as a **Full Stack Developer**, designing and deploying applications that bridge **AI, GIS, embedded systems, and web technologies**. Notable achievements include:  
- Developing a **Java Offline 3D MapViewer** as an alternative to Google Earth.  
- Building a **GIS platform for an electricity company** using GeoServer, PostgreSQL, and OpenLayers.  
- Creating **MapViewer systems** integrating UAV flight planning, offline mapping, and secure communications.  
- Designing a **geospatial coordinate conversion tool** (Flask + DEM).  
- Leading the development of **AI-powered platforms**, such as an image search engine and plant disease estimator (FastAPI, TensorFlow, Keras).  
- Supporting **healthcare services** remotely with Laravel and React at OnePoint Healthcare (UAE).  
- Launching an **e-commerce platform** for brand items (PrestaShop, PHP, MySQL).  

Earlier in my career, I worked extensively on **CNC automation, CAD/embroidery systems, network programming, and digital image processing tools**, gaining deep expertise in **C/C++**, computational geometry, and industrial system integrations.

Today, I continue to work independently and collaboratively, building **innovative, scalable, and user-focused solutions** that merge **academic research with real-world applications**.
